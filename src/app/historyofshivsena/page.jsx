        <p className=" md:mx-16 mx-8 text-justify">
          Shiv Sena is a political party in India, primarily based in the state of Maharashtra. It was founded on June 19, 1966, by Balasaheb Thackeray, a charismatic leader who served as the partys chief until his death in 2012. The partys ideology is centered around Marathi regionalism and Hindu nationalism.
          The early years of Shiv Sena were marked by its emphasis on promoting the interests of the Marathi-speaking population of Maharashtra. It aimed to protect the rights of locals and address the grievances of the Marathi community in areas such as employment, education, and housing. Shiv Senas political ideology also included a strong pro-Hindutva stance, advocating for the rights and welfare of Hindus.
          In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena gained popularity and support through its aggressive and often controversial methods. It organized protests, strikes, and demonstrations to champion the cause of the Marathi people and adopted a confrontational approach towards those it perceived as threats to the interests of Maharashtra.
          Shiv Sena made its mark in Mumbais politics by targeting South Indian migrants, whom it accused of taking away jobs from local residents. The partys members frequently engaged in violent confrontations with migrant workers, leading to significant social tensions in the city during that time.
          Over the years, Shiv Sena expanded its political base and emerged as a major force in Maharashtras politics. In 1995, it formed an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and played a crucial role in the coalition government that came to power in Maharashtra. This alliance continued for many years, with Shiv Sena and BJP jointly contesting and winning several state and national elections.
          However, in recent years, the political dynamics changed. In 2019, Shiv Sena and BJP contested the Maharashtra state elections as alliance partners but faced differences over power-sharing. Shiv Sena insisted on rotating the chief ministers position, which was not agreeable to the BJP. Consequently, Shiv Sena formed an unlikely alliance with the Indian National Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party to form the government in Maharashtra, breaking away from the long-standing alliance with the BJP.

          This move led to a significant shift in Shiv Senas political positioning. The party, under the leadership of Balasaheb Thackerays son Uddhav Thackeray, became the chief minister of Maharashtra. Shiv Sena, while still holding on to its Marathi regionalist roots, adopted a more centrist and pragmatic approach in its governance.
